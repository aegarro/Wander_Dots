As a freshman at my new school, I want to be able to know which dots* are on campus, so I can familiarize myself with an unknown place.

As someone who has already explored my local area, I want the ability control who I share my dots* with, so I can keep my lowkey spots secret with those close to me.
As someone who has limited accessibility, I want to know the difficulty of each adventure*, so that I can choose adventures* that I am able to access.

Definitions:
Dot: A location on a map that a user has saved.
Adventure: A written report of a userâ€™s encounter with a Dot.
